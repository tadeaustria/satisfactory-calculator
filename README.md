# Satisfactory Calculator

## Description

This calculator is meant to help all **Satisfactorians** helping plan their awesome factories. A [Sankey diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankey_diagram) helps to visualize the amount of material flow. Unwanted products can be hidden intuitively to focus on relevant ones.

## Setup 

This implementation is based on JavaScript and requires a web server to be run on and a browser of your choice to be displayed.
For further information see e.g. [apache tutorial](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-and-configure-apache#1-overview) to setup your own web server.
